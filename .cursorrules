# Cursor Rules for Website Generation in PHP & jQuery

- Only use PHP (for server-side) and jQuery (for client-side interactivity).
- Avoid modern frameworks and keep code compatible with PHP 7.x and jQuery 3.x.
- Generate a simple, well-documented website with clear file structure:
  - index.php (main page)
  - assets/ (for CSS, JS, images)
  - Include basic navigation, contact form, and dynamic content loading with jQuery.
- Write clean, readable code with explanatory comments for each section.
- Use only plain HTML, CSS, PHP, and jQueryâ€”no React, Vue, or modern JS features.
- All code should be self-contained and easy to deploy on a shared hosting environment.
- Add usage instructions as comments at the top of each file.
- When generating code, explain the purpose of each file and major function in brief comments.
- Do not generate any code that requires a database unless explicitly requested.
- Prioritize simplicity and compatibility over advanced features.
